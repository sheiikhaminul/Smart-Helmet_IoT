## Introduction
An IoT-integrated smart helmet equipped with innovative and unique safety features. This project proposes a smart helmet system that identifies hazardous situations and enhances rider safety by integrating various sensors and communication technologies.

## Features
- **Helmet Detection:** Ensures the rider is wearing the helmet before ignition starts.
- **Alcohol Monitoring:** Detects if the rider has consumed alcohol and disables ignition if so.
- **Fall Detection:** Detects accidents or falls and automatically turns off the bike ignition.
- **Road Condition Alerts:** Provides notifications about road humps, accident-prone areas, and poor road quality.
- **Emergency SMS Alerts:** Sends GPS location alerts in case of accidents or alcohol detection.
- **ESP-NOW Communication:** Enables real-time communication between helmet and bike unit for safety control.
- **GPS & Grid-Cluster Technique:** Optimizes road condition alert performance.

## Technologies Used
- **ESP32 Microcontroller** for sensor integration and communication
- **Arduino IDE** for firmware development
- **ESP-NOW Protocol** for wireless communication between helmet and bike
- **GPS & GSM Module** for location tracking and sms alert
- **Sensors:** Alcohol sensor, accelerometer (fall detection), helmet detection sensor

## How It Works
The helmet unit continuously monitors safety parameters. If the rider is not wearing the helmet, has consumed alcohol, or if a fall is detected, the system automatically disables the bikeâ€™s ignition. Simultaneously, it monitors road conditions and sends timely alerts to the rider. Emergency SMS notifications are sent with precise GPS location data to pre-designated contacts during hazardous events.
